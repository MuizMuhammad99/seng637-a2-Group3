# 1 Introduction


Our lab aimed to enhance our grasp of automated unit testing, specifically focusing on Black Box Testing using JUnit and related frameworks. The assignment concentrated on creating test code based on unit requirements, executed collaboratively as a group lab. Our primary goal was to generate automated test code using JUnit and XUnit testing frameworks, with a specific focus on the JFreeChart system. This hands-on experience centered around creating automated test code for JFreeChart, a Java artifact utilized for chart calculation and display.

Using the provided instructions, we were able to set up the testing environment, and introduce ourselves to the concept of mocking objects for the purpose creating unit tests for the required methods. Other key components include the use of Javadoc API specifications for the purpose of researching method behaviour and formulating a test plan.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy
## Test Plan for Range and DataUtilities Methods
### Introduction
This test plan outlines the approach to validate the functionality of the **getLowerBound()**, **getUpperBound()**, **getLength()**, **combine()**, and **contains()** methods in the **Range** class, as well as the **calculateRowTotal()**, **calculateColumnTotal()**, **createNumberArray()**, **createNumberArray2D()**, and **getCumulativePercentages()** methods in the **DataUtilities** class. The tests are designed using black-box testing techniques, focusing on equivalence class partitioning, boundary value analysis, and input partitioning to ensure comprehensive coverage of the functionalities.
### Test Items & Features to be tested
* **Range.getLowerBound()**
	* Returns the lower bound for the range. 
* **Range.getUpperBound()**
	* Returns the upper bound for the range.
* **Range.getLength()**
	* Returns the length of the range.
* **Range.combine(Range range1, Range range2)**
	* Returns a new range subsuming both input ranges (possibly null).
* **Range.contains(double value)**
	* Returns true if the range contains the specified value.
* **DataUtilities.calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)**
	* Returns the sum of the values in one row of the supplied data table.
* **DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)**
	* Returns the sum of the values in the specified column. 
* **DataUtilities.createNumberArray(double[] data)**
	* Returns an array of Number objects. 
* **DataUtilities.createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)**
	* Returns an array of Number objects.
* **DataUtilities.getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)**
	* Returns the cumulative percentages. 
### Approach
The approach involves the following steps for each method:
1. Derive the domain for each input variable: Input domains are divided into ranges based on the behavior that the code should exhibit.
2. Define the equivalence classes: Each partition is treated as an equivalent data set.
3. Perform boundary value analysis: Test cases are designed around the values at the edge of equivalence partitions.
4. Design test cases for each equivalence class and boundary value
5. Identify any potential error conditions and create test cases for them
### Test Environment
* Java development environment with JUnit framework.
* Mocking framework for creating test doubles.
### Pre-conditions
* The Range and DataUtilities classes are implemented and compiled without errors.
* JUnit and mocking frameworks are correctly set up in the development environment.
## Test Case Design 
1. Range.getLowerBound()
	* Domain Analysis: The input is the range object, which is characterized by two double values: the lower and upper bounds.
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* Positive range (both bounds positive).
		* Negative range (both bounds negative).
		* Zero boundary (lower bound is 0).
	* Error Guessing:
		* Range with lower bound greater than upper bound (not normally permissible).
	* Test Cases:
		* Test a positive range.
		* Test a negative range.
		* Test a range with zero as the lower bound.
		* Test an invalid range where the lower bound is greater than the upper bound. 
2. Range.getUpperBound()
	* Domain Analysis: The input is the same as for getLowerBound().
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* Positive range (both bounds positive).
		* Negative range (both bounds negative).
		* Zero boundary (upper bound is 0).
	* Error Guessing:
		* Range with upper bound less than lower bound (not normally permissible).
	* Test Cases:
		* Test a positive range.
		* Test a negative range.
		* Test a range with zero as the upper bound.
		* Test an invalid range where the upper bound is less than the lower bound.
3. Range.getLength()
	* Domain Analysis: Dependent on the lower and upper bounds of the range.
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* Positive length (upper bound greater than lower bound).
		* Zero length (upper and lower bounds are equal).
	* Error Guessing:
		* Length calculation with invalid range (upper bound less than lower bound).
	* Test Cases:
		* Test with both bounds positive and different.
		* Test with both bounds negative and different.
  		* Test with the upper bound positive and the lower negative and the same value.
		* Test with upper and lower bounds equal (zero length).
		* Test with a range that is invalid to check if an exception is thrown.
4. Range.combine()
	* Domain Analysis: The inputs are two Range objects i.e., range1 can be null, a range with lower and upper bounds, while range2 can be the same as range1 in terms of possibilities. 
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* Both ranges are null.
  		* The first range is null, while the second is valid.
    		* The first range is valid, while the second is null.
      		* Both ranges are not null and overlapping.
        	* Both ranges are not null and not overlapping.
	* Error Guessing:
		* One range is null.
  		* Both ranges are null.
    		* Ranges are identical.
      		* One range is entirely within the other.
        	* Ranges have a boundary point that is the same.  
	* Test Cases:
		* Test with two null ranges.
  		* Test with the first range being null.
    		* Test with the second range being null.
      		* Test with two overlapping ranges.
        	* Test with two non-overlapping ranges.
5. Range.contains()
	* Domain Analysis: The input is a double value to check for containment within the range.
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* Values are within the bounds of the range.
  		* Values are less than the lower bound of the range.
    		* Values are greater than the upper bound of the range.
      		* Values are exactly at the lower or upper bound of the range.   
	* Error Guessing:
		* A non-numeric value as an input.  
	* Test Cases:
		* Test with a value within the range
  		* Test with a value above the range.
    		* Test with a value at the upper boundary of the range.
      		* Test with a value that is not numeric.  
6. DataUtilities.calculateRowTotal()
	* Domain Analysis:
		* Values2D data: The table of values which can have a varying number of rows and columns.
		* int row: The row index, which is zero-based.
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* A row has exactly two numeric values.
  		* An empty row (no columns).
    		* A row has exactly one numeric value.
      		* A row has mixed positive and negative values.   
	* Boundary Value Analysis:
 		* A scenario of zero columns.
   		* A scenario with the minimum number of columns (one) that still returns a numeric total.
     	* Error Guessing:
      		* Check the robustness of the method against null input.
        * Test Cases:
        	* Test with a row with two values.
         	* Test with an empty row (no columns).
          	* Test with a row with one value.
          	* Test with a row with positive and negative values.
          	* Test with null input.
7. DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal()
   	* Domain Analysis:
		* Values2D data: The table of values which can have a varying number of rows and columns.
		* int column: The column index, which is zero-based.
	* Equivalence Classes:
		* The dataset has no rows.
		* The dataset reports a negative row count, which is technically an invalid state for a dataset.
		* The dataset has rows with large numeric values, including edge cases
		* The dataset is null.
	* Boundary Value Analysis:
		* Boundary between an empty and non-empty dataset: Exactly 0 rows and 1 row

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team was organized into three groups for collaborative coding efforts: 1) Soumini & Fathima, 2) Aemen & Shaun, and 3) Muiz. The division of work within the groups is as follows:

- Soumini & Fathima collaborated on one method from Data Utilities and three from Range.
- Aemen and Shaun worked on one method from Data Utilities and two from Range.
- Muiz contributed to three methods within Data Utilities.

Additionally, the report was a collective effort. The team convened over a virtual call to finalize and complete it collaboratively.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some of the difficulties we encountered were related to the clarification of this assignment. For instance, one of the troubles we had was figuring out the amount of test cases to create for each method. To address this issue, we discussed as a team and decided that it would be in our best interest to generate multiple test cases for each method to ensure robustsness and reliability of our testing methods.

A challenge we had to overcome was the use of mocking objects as understanding the code logic for specific methods posed some difficulty. Some team members struggled to understand certain code parts at first. However, with collaboration we were able to clarify concerns and understandings, overcome these challenges, and get better at using mocking objects.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

What we...

- **Liked:** The structure of the lab as it provided a comprehensive way for us to set up our environment while also being provided sample code on how to start building our unit tests.
- **Disliked:** Not much support was given to learn and use other IDEs. Instructions provided in Eclipse seemed to work fine, however, when importing the JAR files and the accompanying libraries in IntelliJ, it would not work. We feel that it is valuable to learn how to use multiple IDEs and set them up for further knowledge and experience.
- **Found Interesting:** It was quite interesting to learn how to use Mocking objects for our methods and the fact that there are multiple assert statements that interchange depending on the arguments you give it.
- **Found Confusing:** Some assignment instructions were confusing. For example, do we need to write multiple cases for each method or just one case for each method. The assignment instructions suggest the later but does not account for robustness and coverage of our tests in relation to the methods.
- **Found Challenging:** Using the mocking objects were a little challenging, particularly in grasping the code for certain methods. For instance, understanding the intricacies of code logic for specific methods proved challenging.
- **Found Motivating:** The hands-on nature of the lab, especially the practical application of automated unit testing using JUnit and XUnit frameworks, served as a motivating factor. The exposure to real-world scenarios and the opportunity to refine our skills in testing methodologies were encouraging aspects of the lab.
