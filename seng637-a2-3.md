# 1 Introduction


Our lab aimed to enhance our grasp of automated unit testing, specifically focusing on Black Box Testing using JUnit and related frameworks. The assignment concentrated on creating test code based on unit requirements, executed collaboratively as a group lab. Our primary goal was to generate automated test code using JUnit and XUnit testing frameworks, with a specific focus on the JFreeChart system. This hands-on experience centered around creating automated test code for JFreeChart, a Java artifact utilized for chart calculation and display.

Using the provided instructions, we were able to set up the testing environment, and introduce ourselves to the concept of mocking objects for the purpose creating unit tests for the required methods. Other key components include the use of Javadoc API specifications for the purpose of researching method behaviour and formulating a test plan.
