# 1 Introduction


Our lab aimed to enhance our grasp of automated unit testing, specifically focusing on Black Box Testing using JUnit and related frameworks. The assignment concentrated on creating test code based on unit requirements, executed collaboratively as a group lab. Our primary goal was to generate automated test code using JUnit and XUnit testing frameworks, with a specific focus on the JFreeChart system. This hands-on experience centered around creating automated test code for JFreeChart, a Java artifact utilized for chart calculation and display.

Using the provided instructions, we were able to set up the testing environment, and introduce ourselves to the concept of mocking objects for the purpose creating unit tests for the required methods. Other key components include the use of Javadoc API specifications for the purpose of researching method behaviour and formulating a test plan.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team was organized into three groups for collaborative coding efforts: 1) Soumini & Fathima, 2) Aemen & Shaun, and 3) Muiz. The division of work within the groups is as follows:

- Soumini & Fathima collaborated on one method from Data Utilities and three from Range.
- Aemen and Shaun worked on one method from Data Utilities and two from Range.
- Muiz contributed to three methods within Data Utilities.

Additionally, the report was a collective effort. The team convened over a virtual call to finalize and complete it collaboratively.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some of the difficulties we encountered were related to the clarification of this assignment. For instance, one of the troubles we had was figuring out the amount of test cases to maek for each method. To address this issue, we discussed as a team and decided that it would be in our best interest to create multiple test cases for each method to ensure robustsness and reliability of our testing methods.

A challenge we had to overcome was the use of mocking objects as understanding the code logic for specific methods was a bit tough. Some team members struggled to understand certain code parts at first. However, with collaboration we were able to clarify concerns and understandings, overcome these challenges and get better at using mocking objects.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

What we...

- **Liked:** The structure of the lab as it provided a comprehensive way for us to set up our environment while also being provided sample code on how to start building our unit tests.
- **Disliked:** Not much support was given to learn and use other IDEs. Instructions provided in Eclipse seemed to work fine, however, when importing the JAR files and the accompanying libraries in IntelliJ, it would not work. We feel that it is valuable to learn how to use multiple IDEs and set them up for further knowledge and experience.
- **Found Interesting:** It was quite interesting to learn how to use Mocking objects for our methods and the fact that there are multiple assert statements that interchange depending on the arguments you give it.
- **Found Confusing:** Some assignment instructions were confusing. For example, do we need to write multiple cases for each method or just one case for each method. The assignment instructions suggest the later but does not account for robustness and coverage of our tests in relation to the methods.
- **Found Challenging:** Using the mocking objects were a little challenging, particularly in grasping the code for certain methods. For instance, understanding the intricacies of code logic for specific methods proved challenging.
- **Found Motivating:** The hands-on nature of the lab, especially the practical application of automated unit testing using JUnit and XUnit frameworks, served as a motivating factor. The exposure to real-world scenarios and the opportunity to refine our skills in testing methodologies were encouraging aspects of the lab.
